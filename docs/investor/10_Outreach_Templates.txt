Subject: RAIN (OPERAIN) — audit‑ready AI for factories — $1.0M SAFE

Hi <Name>,

We’re building OPERAIN — a seven‑step suite that turns a site survey into running, audit‑ready operations with evidence by default. We’re raising **$1,000,000 on a post‑money SAFE** (cap target **$15M**) for 12–15 months of runway to ship the hub + Steps 2 & 7 and scale to 3–6 paying sites.

Why we win: stepwise value, evidence locker (signed artifacts), and reliability posture (signing, SBOM, policy gates). First three customers get intro pricing (¼ target) to accelerate references and cohorts.

If this fits your thesis, I can share the one‑pager, deck outline, and data room.

Best,
Oliver
