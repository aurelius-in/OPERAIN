# Revenue Ramp to $1 Million
###### *(Scenarios and Assumptions)*

## Executive Summary

This memo outlines credible timelines to reach either 1) $1M in annual recurring revenue or 2) $1M in cash collected. The paths depend on price per site, pilot conversion, sales cycle length, and pipeline volume.

## Definitions

* $1M ARR target: $83,333 in monthly recurring revenue.
* $1M cash collected: upfront payments, annual prepay, and services can accelerate cash before ARR crosses $1M.

## Pricing Anchors

* OPERAIN Suite per site target: $25k to $60k per month.
* Intro lighthouse pricing: approximately one quarter of target.
* Example used below: Suite at $25k target, intro at $6.25k.

## Scenarios to $1M ARR

### Aggressive timeline — 6 to 9 months

**Assumptions**

* Pilot conversion: 40 percent.
* First 3 sites at intro pricing, next 7 at mid tier.
* Sales cycle: 60 to 90 days from first meeting.

**Illustrative monthly ramp**

* Month 2: 2 sites at $6.25k each → $12.5k MRR
* Month 3: +2 sites at $6.25k → $25k MRR
* Month 4: +2 sites at $12.5k → $50k MRR
* Month 6: +3 sites at $12.5k → $87.5k MRR → $1.05M ARR
* Month 9: +3 sites at $12.5k → $125k MRR → $1.5M ARR

**Operational requirements**

* Pipeline of about 25 qualified plants to close 10 in 6 to 9 months.
* Two closers, or one closer plus a partner channel.

### Base case — 10 to 14 months

**Assumptions**

* Pilot conversion: 25 to 30 percent.
* Price mix skews lower for longer.
* Sales cycle: 90 to 120 days.

**Illustrative monthly ramp**

* Month 3: 2 sites at $6.25k → $12.5k MRR
* Month 6: +3 sites at $6.25k → $31.25k MRR
* Month 9: +3 sites at $12.5k → $68.75k MRR
* Month 12: +2 sites at $12.5k → $93.75k MRR
* Month 14: +1 site at $12.5k → $106.25k MRR → $1.275M ARR

**Operational requirements**

* Pipeline of 35 to 40 qualified plants to win 9 to 11.
* One FTE seller, one founder-led seller, references from first 3.

### Conservative — 18 months and beyond

**Assumptions**

* Pilot conversion: 15 to 20 percent.
* Longer procurement and security reviews.
* Extended time at intro pricing.

**Implication**

* Reach $1M ARR after 12 to 16 sites at $6.25k to $10k each.

## Target Math

| Average MRR per site | Sites required for $1M ARR |
| -------------------: | -------------------------: |
|               $6,250 |                         14 |
|              $10,000 |                          9 |
|              $12,500 |                          7 |
|              $25,000 |                          4 |

## Cash Collected vs ARR

* Annual prepay with a 10 to 15 percent discount accelerates cash.
  Example: 6 sites at $12.5k MRR on annual prepay equals approximately $900k collected at signing. Add onboarding fees and services to clear $1M cash before crossing $1M ARR.

## Funnel Targets — Base Case

Work 120 accounts to achieve:

* 40 SQLs
* 20 pilots
* 6 closed won

Scale this once references land. Maintain a 90 day rolling top of funnel.

## Acceleration Levers

* Price design: per site base plus per line add-ons to reach $10k to $15k MRR quickly in mid-sized plants.
* Prepay: 12 month prepay with small discount and a services bundle.
* Reference program: first 3 lighthouse logos at intro price with contractual reference commitments.
* Partner attach: systems integrators contribute 2 sites per quarter with a standard referral arrangement.
* Time-boxed pilots: 45 days with weekly evidence and opt-out on day 45, otherwise auto-convert.

## Risk Controls

* Payback months and NRR: target payback under 9 months and NRR at or above 110 percent.
* Guard price creep: intro pricing ends after 12 months with a written step-up schedule.
* Churn control: keep logo churn under 2 percent monthly. Escalate red accounts by week 2 of pilot.

## Bottom Line

* Fastest credible path to $1M ARR: 6 to 9 months by landing about 10 sites at a blended $8.75k to $12.5k MRR.
* Fastest credible path to $1M cash collected: 4 to 6 sites on annual prepay at $12.5k to $25k MRR plus onboarding fees.
