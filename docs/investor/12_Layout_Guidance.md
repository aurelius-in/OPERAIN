# Logo & Layout Guidance

- Maintain aspect ratio for both **OPERAIN** and **RAIN** logos; avoid stretching or squashing.  
- Place **RAIN** logo (small) top‑right with “Reliable AI Network, Inc.” in small bold text next to it.  
- Ensure text and tables **wrap within page margins**; enable cell text wrapping for Use‑of‑Funds and pricing tables.  
- Bullet lines that use a colon: **bold the lead‑in up to the colon**, normal weight after.  
- Use consistent header hierarchy and page numbers; avoid cramming content on one line (e.g., break long titles).
