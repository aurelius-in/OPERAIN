# Security & Compliance Posture

- **Software Supply Chain:** Signed images, SBOM generation & verification, policy gates in CI/CD.  
- **Access Controls:** Least privilege, SSO/SAML, audited roles; customer data isolation by tenant.  
- **Observability:** Immutable audit logs; evidence locker with signed artifacts.  
- **Privacy & DPAs:** Standard DPA; subprocessors list; data residency options.  
- **SOC 2 Plan:** Readiness by Month 9; penetration test by Month 10; policies and controls mapped to Trust Services Criteria.  
- **Incident Response:** 24×7 on‑call; RTO/RPO targets; post‑incident customer report within 5 business days.
