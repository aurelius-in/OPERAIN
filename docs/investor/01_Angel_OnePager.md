# Reliable AI Network (RAIN) — OPERAIN Suite
**Stage:** Seed | **Ask:** $1,000,000 (post-money SAFE) | **Use:** 12–15 months runway  
**Company:** Reliable AI Network, Inc. (Delaware C‑Corp)  
**Product:** OPERAIN — a seven‑step suite to take a site survey to **running, audit‑ready operations**: Plan → Procure & Provision → Prove → Run → Comply → Operate → Improve.

## Why now
- Manufacturers need verifiable AI that **ships outcomes** and **keeps receipts** (evidence locker).  
- Rising adoption of AI/vision/edge with budget growth and Lighthouse benchmarks.

## What we sell (initial SKUs)
- **OPERAIN Suite (per site):** orchestrator + Step 2 (Provision) + Step 7 (Improve) with evidence locker.  
- Standalone: BayWalk, PerceptionLab, EdgeSight‑QA, RAINLane, DriftHawk.

## Traction (early)
- 45‑day beta program with structured weekly outcomes and license‑key gating.
- First three customers at **intro pricing (¼ target)** to accelerate references and cohorts.

## Go‑to‑market
- Field pilots (45 days), land per‑site suite, expand with SKUs.  
- Channel partners for integrations; repeatable proof → rollout.

## Moat
- **Evidence by default**: signed releases, model reports, pass/fail images, SOP citations → audit‑ready.  
- Reliability posture (signing, SBOM, policy gates), modular orchestration, and stepwise value.

## Team
- Founder‑led engineering with shipped multi‑agent, RAG, governance tooling; staged hiring tied to milestones.

## The ask and terms
- **$1,000,000 SAFE (post‑money cap target $15M)** with pro‑rata and info rights.  
- Illustrative ownership ≈ **6.7%** at a $15M post. Optional small revenue share kicker that sunsets when repaid.

## Milestones funded (12–15 months)
- Ship OPERAIN Hub + Steps 2 & 7 to production; 3–6 paying sites; NRR ≥ 110%; SOC 2 readiness; 99.9% SLO.
- ARR targets: $1.5–$3.0M run‑rate depending on cohort curve.
