# Seed Proposal

$1,000,000 on a post-money SAFE

## Executive summary
OPERAIN turns a site survey into running, audit-ready operations: **Plan -> Procure and Provision -> Prove -> Run -> Comply -> Operate -> Improve**. This round funds the hub and Steps 2 and 7 while linking to five existing apps.

## Use of funds (12 to 15 months)

| Category | Allocation | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Marketing, outreach, and sales | 25% | $250,000 | Field marketing, events, content, solution demos, pilot acquisition, sales ops |
| Development, improvements, and maintenance | 20% | $200,000 | OPERAIN hub, Step 2 and Step 7, evidence locker, reliability, webhooks |
| Security and compliance | 15% | $150,000 | Image signing, SBOM, policy gates, SOC 2 readiness |
| Pilot services (offset by revenue) | 15% | $150,000 | On-site integration, SCADA connectors, change management support |
| Cloud and tooling | 10% | $100,000 | Hosting, observability, CI/CD, test environments |
| G and A and legal | 10% | $100,000 | Contracts, accounting, IP, insurance |
| Contingency and reserve | 5% | $50,000 | Unforeseen costs |

## 45-day beta program

- **Length:** 45 days of full-feature access for one site or one line.
- **Entry:** Billing details are collected upfront; billing begins on day 46 unless the customer opts out in-app before day 45.
- **Expectation:** One brief survey per week (5 to 8 minutes) on usability, value, and outcomes such as savings, throughput, and error rates.
- **Key issuance:** Each completed weekly survey unlocks the next week's license key; if a survey is more than 7 days late, access pauses until it is completed.
- **Value promise:** Customers keep their data and reports regardless of purchase decision.
- **Goal:** Customers validate savings and reliability on their own floor; we capture precise, on-site feedback to improve rapidly.

## Pricing strategy

First three customers receive 12-month pricing at one-quarter of target. On day 46, subscriptions begin at the intro rate unless the customer opts out. New customers after the first three will see modest quarterly list increases as the product matures.

| SKU | Intro monthly (1/4 target) | Target monthly |
|---|---|---|
| BayWalk | $500 | $2,000 |
| PerceptionLab | $750 | $3,000 |
| EdgeSight-QA (per line) | $2,500 to $5,000 | $10,000 to $20,000 |
| RAINLane | $750 to $1,500 | $3,000 to $6,000 |
| DriftHawk (per cluster) | $1,250 to $3,000 | $5,000 to $12,000 |
| OPERAIN Step 2 (suite-only) | $750 to $1,500 | $3,000 to $6,000 |
| OPERAIN Step 7 (suite-only) | $1,000 to $2,000 | $4,000 to $8,000 |
| OPERAIN Suite (per site) | $6,250 to $15,000 | $25,000 to $60,000 |

## What the investor gets

- **Primary structure:** post-money SAFE with a valuation cap (example: $15M post), pro-rata rights, and information rights.
- A $1,000,000 investment at a $15,000,000 post implies about **6.7%** ownership. No dividends assumed.
- **ROI scenarios:** $3M ARR at 6x = $18M value; $8M ARR at 7x = $56M value. Equity value for 6.7% is ~$1.2M and ~$3.75M, respectively. These are illustrative.
- **Optional kicker (negotiable):** 1% of topline until $250,000 is repaid, then sunset.

## Proof, safety, and diligence

- **Evidence by default:** Signed releases, model reports, pass or fail images, and SOP citations are captured in an evidence locker.
- **Customer pilots:** 45-day structured beta with weekly outcomes. Data is linked to specific batches, SKUs, and change tickets.
- **References:** We will provide customer and advisor references, along with demo access and architecture documentation.
- **Security posture:** Image signing, SBOM, and policy gates; SOC 2 readiness plan.
- **Financial discipline:** Fixed budget, staged hiring, and a 5 percent contingency reserve.
